# BabySoC Fundamentals
------------------------------
## SOC (System-On-Chip)
------------------------------
A System-on-Chip integrates all essential parts of a computing system—such as the processor, memory, communication interfaces, and peripheral devices—onto a single silicon die.
Instead of using multiple chips on a PCB, SoCs combine everything into one integrated circuit, which results in lower power consumption, smaller size, and faster performance.

SoCs are widely used in embedded systems, mobile devices, automotive electronics, and AI accelerators, where efficiency and compactness are key.
