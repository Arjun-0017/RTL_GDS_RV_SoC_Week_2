# BabySoC Fundamentals
------------------------------
## What is SOC (System-On-Chip)?
------------------------------
A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is an integrated circuit that combines all essential components of a computing system —  
the **processor**, **memory**, **communication interfaces**, and **peripherals** — onto a single silicon die.

Instead of connecting multiple chips on a PCB, SoCs integrate everything into one compact IC, resulting in:

- ⚡ Higher performance  
- 🔋 Lower power consumption  
- 📏 Smaller form factor  
- 💰 Reduced cost

SoCs are the backbone of embedded systems, smartphones, IoT devices, and AI accelerators.

## 🧩 Components of a Typical SoC

A standard SoC contains the following major building blocks:

1. **Processor (CPU / Core)**  
   - Executes instructions and manages overall system operation.  
   - Often based on architectures such as **RISC-V** or **ARM**.

2. **Memory Units**  
   - Includes **SRAM**, **ROM**, and controllers for **DRAM** or **Flash**.  
   - Stores both code and runtime data.

3. **Peripherals**  
   - Interfaces for communication: **UART**, **SPI**, **I²C**, **GPIO**, **Timers**, etc.  
   - Enables external device control and interaction.

4. **Interconnect / Bus Fabric**  
   - The communication backbone connecting CPU, memory, and peripherals.  
   - Examples: **AXI**, **AHB**, **APB**.  
   - Manages data transfer, arbitration, and address decoding.

5. **Glue Logic & Support Blocks**  
   - Clock/reset circuits, power gating, and domain crossing logic.  
   - Maintains synchronization and power efficiency.

6. **Hardware Accelerators (Optional)**  
   - Specialized processing blocks for AI, DSP, or cryptographic workloads.

## 🧮 Role of Functional Modelling Before RTL & Physical Design

Before diving into RTL coding or physical design, engineers develop **functional models** — high-level behavioral representations of the SoC.

### 💡 Purpose of Functional Modelling

1. **Early Design Validation**  
   - Detects logical and architectural issues early in the process.  

2. **Rapid Design Exploration**  
   - Enables testing different configurations (bus width, memory size, etc.) quickly.  

3. **Golden Reference for Verification**  
   - Serves as a baseline for verifying RTL correctness.  

4. **Supports Early Software Development**  
   - Allows firmware and driver development before silicon is ready.  

5. **Smooth RTL Transition**  
   - Ensures functional consistency through all design stages.
